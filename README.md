# School District Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
The broad goal of this project is to create a high level analysis of the school districts key performance. Specifically, all of the students math and reading standardized test data will be aggregated for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. This analysis will assist the school board on making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. To accomplish this, Python (Pandas Library) and Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook) were used due to the tools that both offer when it comes to complex data analysis. Data visualizations will be created for the following: 
	- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
	- Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
	- The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
	- The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
	- School performance based on the budget per student
	- School performance based on the school size 
	- School performance based on the type of school
During the analysis it was discovered that the 9th grade students at Thomas High School had invalid data as their math and reading scores. This resulted in all reading and math scores for these students being deleted. The analysis was then redone with this change. The effect of the removal of those scores will be explored in the results section.

## Resources
	- Data Sources: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
	- Software: Python 3.7 (Pandas Library), Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook package), Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

## Results
 - How is the district summary affected?
 - How is the school summary affected?
 - How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
 - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	- Math and reading scores by grade
	- Scores by school spending
	- Scores by school size
	- Scores by school type


## Summary **Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with Na**
